// This is done as shown: 
// 1. The constructor typically receives and Object of the CORE
// 2. The constructor calls to the constructor of the superclass Menu with two parameters: the title of the MENU and a list of commands that receive the core entity
// 3. In this exemple, the menu menu represents the operations avalable for changing the list of numbers kept by the applciation
